# AI Agents Context — Varisankya Monorepo

Authoritative context for AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.) working across this repo. Per-platform detail is in each platform's own `AGENTS.md`; this file covers cross-cutting concerns.

Keep this file current when conventions change. Do **not** add per-session activity logs — git history is the record.

All three apps talk to the **same Firebase project**: `helloworld-92567418`.

## Core mandates (apply everywhere)

1. **Security is the top priority.** Never commit secrets, keys, or tokens. Before any force-push or history-rewrite, grep the full git history for: private key patterns (`BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY`), Firebase API keys (`AIza`), OAuth secrets (`GOCSPX-`), service-account JSON (`play_console_key`). See [[security-utmost-priority]].

2. **Secret management = Bitwarden CLI (`bw`).** The unlock pattern is settled — see `DISASTER_RECOVERY.md §ADR-001` (do not re-litigate). Quick reference:
   - Credentials file: `.env` at repo root (`BW_CLIENTID`, `BW_CLIENTSECRET`, `BW_PASSWORD`). Template: `.env.example`. Must be `chmod 600`.
   - **Preferred unlock helper:** `source scripts/bw_unlock.sh` — handles login + unlock idempotently.
   - Legacy Android-only path: `android/.env.local` (key `BW_PASSWORD`); still used by `android/retrieve_secrets.sh`.
   - On Windows, `bw` is at `C:\Users\Aarsh\AppData\Roaming\npm\bw.cmd` — use the full path from Python subprocess.
   - See `android/.agent/skills/bitwarden-secrets/SKILL.md` for the skill definition.

3. **Firestore data model must stay identical across platforms.** `shared/domain/SPEC.md` is the canonical definition. Field names, types, recurrence strings, and payment dual-write layout must match between Android, iOS, and web. If you change a field name on one platform, update all three and the spec.

4. **Web auth uses a same-origin reverse-proxy.** `web/next.config.ts` proxies `/__/auth/*` to Firebase. `authDomain` is set to `window.location.hostname`. Any new domain must be added to the Google OAuth 2.0 Web client's Authorized redirect URIs (`<domain>/__/auth/handler`) and Authorized JavaScript origins.

5. **No cross-language code generation.** Kotlin/Swift/TypeScript cannot share compiled code without KMP or a shared-TS core — both are out of scope. Shared logic lives in the domain spec + golden test vectors, not in generated code.

6. **Commit directly to `main` (repo) and `master` (wiki) — never open pull requests or feature branches.** The owner manages these repos directly and explicitly does not want PRs. When asked to commit code, docs, or wiki changes, push straight to the default branch. This **overrides** any default "branch first on the default branch" agent behaviour. (Still applies: only commit/push when the user asks, and never bypass mandate 1 — no secrets, ever.)

7. **Family-wide assets live in `hora-core`** (`C:\Users\Aarsh\Source\hora-core`, public, same no-PR/direct-to-main rule). Currently shared from this app: the notification-icon standard + generator (`brand/notification-icon/`, Varisankya's `android/tools/gen_notification_icon.py` is the working instance). Before adding a new cross-app convention or skill, check `hora-core/docs/conventions.md` first — and confirm at least one other Hora app actually needs it before promoting something there, since it's reviewed against multiple agent sessions working in parallel on that repo.

   **Shared skills are consumed via a sync script — never hand-edit them here.** `android/tools/sync_shared_skills.sh` copies the shared skills Varisankya uses from the local hora-core checkout into `android/.agent/skills/`. Those copies are **generated** (listed in `android/.agent/skills/.hora-core-synced`): to change one, edit the canonical version in `hora-core/.github/skills/` and re-run the script — do not edit the copy in this repo. Currently synced: `agent-session-closing`, `agent-skill-standards`, `hora-app-release`, `hora-launcher-icon`, `hora-play-store`, `m3e-animation-standards`, `m3e-haptic-standards`, `m3e-swipe-standards`, `skeleton-loading-standards`, `settings-page-standards`, `android-platform-standards`, `shared-android-source` (`android-platform-standards` was generalized + renamed from the old local `android-15-standards`, now removed; `hora-play-store` replaced `play-store-release`; `hora-app-release` was added once the machine-global release skill was retired). Still **app-local** (not shared): `app-performance-standards`, `m3-dynamic-colors`, `app-readiness-policy`, and the Varisankya-specific feature/finance skills. **`bitwarden-secrets` stays local and is NOT synced** — it's Varisankya's app-specific secret runbook (real vault item/field names); `hora-bitwarden-secrets` in hora-core is the scrubbed public method, not a substitute. All other `.agent/skills/` entries are Varisankya-specific and untouched by the sync. This is the family's chosen consumption mechanism (hora-core `docs/conventions.md` → "Agent skills").

   **Shared Android *source* is also consumed from hora-core — never hand-edit it here.** `android/tools/sync_shared_android.sh` copies the canonical Hora-family Android source from `hora-core/shared/android/` into this app: the design-token resources (`res/values/{dimens,type,styles_shared,colors,ids,attrs}.xml`, `res/color/chip_{background,text,stroke}_color.xml`) and the Kotlin utils (`util/ChipHelper.kt`, `util/ThemeHelper.kt`, `util/AnimationHelper.kt`), rewriting the `__HORA_PKG__` package placeholder to `com.hora.varisankya`. These are **generated** (listed in `android/tools/.hora-core-synced-android`; each file carries a "do not hand-edit" header) — to change one, edit the canonical in `hora-core/shared/android/` and re-run the script. `AnimationHelper` still depends on this app's `Constants.ANIM_*` tokens. `res/values/styles_shared.xml` holds the byte-identical `Widget.App.*` / `ShapeAppearance.App.*` / `App.*` styles; this app's own `themes.xml` keeps only `Theme.*` + the styles that genuinely diverge from Pathivu (the text-field box style + the destructive button). See the `shared-android-source` skill.

   **Working with hora-core directly.** The cross-session agent-mailbox protocol has been **retired** (hora-core commit `135e82d`; user decision). App agents now commit to hora-core `main` and its wiki `master` **directly** when the user asks — there is no agent-to-agent coordination channel. hora-core's `docs/agent-resume.md` is the shared, committed record; append a dated entry there when you make a lasting change to a shared component, and read it (plus `docs/conventions.md`) when picking up shared-component work.

## Playwright browser automation (agent tool)

When using Playwright MCP to drive browser UI, prefer `browser_evaluate` over `browser_click` for any selector that is not a simple CSS id or plain aria-label:

```js
// Prefer this pattern — works even when pointer-events are blocked by overlapping elements
await page.evaluate(() => {
  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button'))
    .find(b => b.textContent.trim() === 'Delete')
    ?.click();
});
```

Known gotchas encountered in this project:
- **Play Console** — the spinner sometimes never hides; take a screenshot to confirm load, then navigate by extracted `href` instead of waiting.
- **Firebase Console delete button** — a `<td>` intercepts pointer events; use `dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', {bubbles:true}))` on the button directly.
- **Google account signup QR code** — expires in ~3 minutes; always scan immediately when shown.
- **`browser_click` with smart-quoted aria labels** — fails with CSS selector error; use `browser_evaluate` with `textContent.trim()` comparison.
- **`bw` pipe through heredoc on Windows** — `bw create item "$(cat <<'EOF'...)"` fails with "Error parsing encoded request data"; use Python subprocess with `bw encode` + `bw create item` as two steps.

## Current release state (2026-07-10)

| Platform | Version | Track / Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | v3.9-beta.28 (versionCode 85) | Play **Beta** (Open Testing) — real System-font toggle fix (shared `type.xml` via `?attr/fontFamily`); production track carries stable **v3.8** (vc 57) |
| iOS | 3.8 (build auto-bumped by CI) | Awaiting Apple enrollment (cases #102900128848 + #102905434551 + #102927880856); source carries the app-wide font-toggle fix, ships once enrollment clears |
| Web | latest `main` | Vercel production — new വരി favicon + PWA icons |

> **Release tracks (owner-directed policy, 2026-07-10):** exactly **two** channels —
> every beta goes to **Open Testing** (`beta`, GPP's default track) and every stable cut
> to **Production**. The **internal** and **closed (`alpha`)** tracks are **retired**;
> never pass `-PplayTrack=internal`/`alpha`. **Every Play release also requires a
> corresponding GitHub Release** (tag `v<versionName>`, signed release APK attached,
> pre-release flag for betas). The `hora-app-release` skill's internal→closed flow is a
> skeleton for new apps still under Play's one-time testing gate — Varisankya cleared it
> at v3.8. See `android/CLI_RELEASE_GUIDE.md` and the wiki **Build & Release** page.

## Disaster Recovery

Full DR runbooks, secret inventory, vault coverage audit, and 2FA recovery
locations are documented in **`DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`** at the repo root.
That document also contains the ADR explaining the `.env` / master-password
design (§ADR-001) — treat it as settled.

Key helpers:
- `scripts/bw_unlock.sh` — sources `.env`, logs in via API key, unlocks vault, exports `BW_SESSION`. Source it before any `bw get` call.
- `android/retrieve_secrets.sh` — pulls Android secrets from the `Varisankya` BW item (calls `bw_unlock.sh` internally via the `.env.local` fallback).
- `ios/scripts/check_apple_secrets.sh` — audits the 9 GitHub Secrets required for the iOS release workflow.

---

## Gitignored secrets (never commit these)

```
*.pem  *.csr  *.p12  *.cer  *.mobileprovision
google-services.json  GoogleService-Info.plist
*.env.local  play_console_key.json
varisankya-upload-key  AuthKey_*.p8
```

The root `.gitignore` enforces these. Each platform directory also has its own `.gitignore`. Belt-and-suspenders intentional.
